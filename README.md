I am a Computer Engineer student and an aspiring programmer. I have learned that curiosity is the best quality in the field of software development, so I have started to create some projects that I will regularly post here.

For most of my life I was an English teacher and I am currently undergoing a carreer transition into technology/programming. Because of this I live in a continuous learning process, so, if you have any suggestions or wants to give some advice, feel free to reach me!
